Types of Data Structure: Physical and Logical Data Structure

Physical DS is meant for actually storing data and Logical DS is used to decide how data will be stored and accessed.

Physical:

    Array - Used when we know the size and want to use Stack memory
    Linked List- Used when the size is dynamic and want to use Heap memory

Logical:

    Stack (Linear) - LIFO
    Queue (Linear) - FIFO
    Trees (Non-Linear) - 
    Graph (Non-Linear) - 
    Hash Table (Tabular) -
