/* Access Modifiers: Private | Public | Protected
    // Private: The class members declared as private can be accessed only by the member functions inside the class.

    // Public: All the class members declared under the public specifier will be available to everyone
                and can be accessed anywhere throughout the program.

    // Protected: The protected access modifier is similar to the private access modifier in the sense that
                it canâ€™t be accessed outside of its class unless with the help of a friend class (Inherited from base class).

If no access modifier is mentioned, it takes the default modifier that is `private`
